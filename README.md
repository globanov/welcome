This is draft of test access to host and analyze content result of default page.
Not all functionality realized, this is just a DRAFT.

Now implemented:
1. Host ip verification.
2. Access to host url using local settting.
3. Access to host overwriting proxy settings(without proxy).

Need to implement:
1. Connet to host via ssh.
2. Analyze apache logs: if there is no data about connection - problem with network.
3. Analyze iptables rules.
